\title{Location estimates based on directional projection depth.}
\description{
Computes a directional projection depth based location estimate of a 
\eqn{p}-dimensional dataset \code{x}.
}
\usage{
dprojmedian(x, dprojection.depths = NULL, options = NULL)
}
\arguments{
    \item{x}{An \eqn{n} by \eqn{p} data matrix with observations
             in the rows and variables in the columns.}
  \item{dprojection.depths}{Vector containing the directional projection
                  depths of the points in \code{x}.}
  \item{options}{ A list of options to pass to the \code{dprojdepth} routine.
                  See \code{dprojdepth} for more details. }

}
\details{
 The algorithm depends on the function \code{dprojdepth} to calculate the
 directional projection depths of the dataset \code{x}. If the 
 directional projection depths of the points \eqn{x_i} have already been
 calculated they can be passed as an optional argument to save computation time.
 If not, directional projection depths will be calculated and the user 
 can pass a list with options to the \code{dprojdepth} function.

 It is first checked whether the data lie in a subspace of dimension smaller 
 than \eqn{p}. If so, a warning is given, as well as the dimension of the 
 subspace and a direction which is orthogonal to it.

\value{
  A list with components: \cr
    \item{max}{The point of \code{x} with maximal directional projection 
               depth. If multiple points have maximum depth, their center
               of gravity is returned}
    \item{gravity}{The center of gravity for the 50 percent points with
                   highest directional projection depth. Also called
                   the center of gravity of the bag.}
